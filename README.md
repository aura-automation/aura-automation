Aura is very minimalistic and very efficient. The most important thing to realize about Aura is that it creates a simple xml representation of your config without requiring heavy tools. Traditional/Commercial tools require a database, server-side code, UI which is self defeating when you want rapid time to market.

Therefore if you like to keep things simple and you prefer the command-line over an admin panel UI then give Aura a try.

Developers like Aura because we can write configuration like we write code:

    Ability to write configuration in XML in your favorite text-editor.
    Ability to preview changes against environments.
    No release notes or manaul steps required.
    Ability to extract configuration from know good envirnment.
    Ability to version configuration with source code.
    Ability to use rules to block certain configuration types.
    Easy to read reports.
